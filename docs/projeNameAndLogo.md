## 🎯 FINAL DECISION: **AgentFirewall**

### Why AgentFirewall Wins (Despite Lower Score)

**Strategic Alignment:**
- ✅ Perfect match with "Agent Firewall" positioning
- ✅ Directly communicates our core differentiation

**Practical Reasons:**
- ✅ Domain likely available (agentfirewall.ai)
- ✅ Zero confusion about what it does
- ✅ Technical audience (our target) loves descriptive names
- ✅ Easier to explain to investors/customers

**Why Not Sentinel.ai?**
- ⚠️ Domain expensive/taken
- ⚠️ Less specific (requires explanation)
- ⚠️ Doesn't reinforce "firewall" positioning

**Trade-off Accepted:**
- We sacrifice "premium feel" for clarity
- We sacrifice scalability for focus
- **This is correct for MVP stage**

### Pivot Option

If we pivot to broader AI security (not just agents):
- **Rebrand to:** Sentinel.ai or Perimeter.ai
- **Keep:** AgentFirewall as product line
